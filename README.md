## Overview
This repository contains code for the Card Mine iOS App. 
  
Card Mine is a simple card factory that helps you generate, design, and share different kinds of cards along with text stamps and keep them save online !

It's is intended to be my capstone project in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree. 


## Back-End 
[Card Mine API](https://cardmine.herokuapp.com/) powers the app. It's open sourced in [its own repo](https://github.com/abarrak/card-mine-api).
